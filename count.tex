This paper examines how societies can coordinate fairly when nation-states cannot manage our common ecosystem alone.
It recognises that no society is entirely free from political realities or the costs involved in maintaining social order.
As a result, ideal propositions of social cooperation, such as John Rawls’s The Law of Peoples, remain incomplete when considering practical application.
We introduce the Commonwealth Cost of Carbon, as a new Ecosystem Performance Observation that measures how much societies spend to maintain order relative to their total activity.
This ratio provides a transparent and replicable way to assess global ecosystem performance without relying on expert computational resorces or privileged information.
Between 2000 and 2020, this cost increased from \approx2000\$65 to \approx2020\$140 per tonne of CO2e, suggesting both a decline in ecosystem performance and a rising social value for emission reduction.
Building on this indicator, we propose the Commonwealth of Peoples as a new trade association, that translates moral duty into service performance.
Here, a complementary Service Rating is introduced, serving as a cost–benefit ratio that qualifies the industrial nature of sites.
Together, these tools provide a performance-based foundation of ecosystem governance that provides an assured approach to move a society from alarm to action.
